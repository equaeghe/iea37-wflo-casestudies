# NOTE:
# 1. Below, some white space is added to make the text less cramped. For this,
#    comments are used, so starting with ‘#’ and then a number of tildes (‘~’)
#    equal to the number of levels deep in the property tree we are at.
# 2. $schema, $id, and $ref field values should be wrapped in double quotes
#    (‘"’) to protect special characters such as ‘#’
# 3. The line length has been kept below 80 characters for readability; for
#    this the folded and chomped YAML style indicated by ‘>-’ is convenient.
